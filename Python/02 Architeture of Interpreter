Architecture of Interpreter:

    Source Code:
        - It is a code which is written by the user.
        - Generally It is a high level language.
        - Sice computer do not understand high level language.
        - The source code should be converted into low level language.
        - To make this possible we need a translator.

    Translator:
        - It is a device used to convert high level language to low level language.
        - Generally we have a two types of translator.
            i)  Compiler
            ii) Interpreter

    Compiler:
        - It is a translator which checks the whole programs for any error when there are no error the program will
          execute.If it even a single error then execution is not possible, here the code is checked for any error and
          it is converted to .pyc file [compile python file].

    Lexer: [Breaks the code]
        - It is a component in translator which splits the code into tokens.

    Parser: [Build the connections]
        - It is used for parsing which means it forms a relation between the instructions.
          Here there is a formation AST[Abstract Syntax Tree]

    PVM or Interpreter:
        - It stands for Python Virtual machine. Here .pyc file is converted to a run time code.
          This code is parsed to the ALU which performs the necessary operations.
        - After the operations the response is send back to the user.
